# Raw Footage Provider Metadata

## Goal

- [x] Replace the old YouTube-only raw footage flow with provider-aware metadata and live preview support.

## Scope

- Keep `raw_footage_url` as the single visible input for the client.
- Detect supported providers from the entered URL and persist derived metadata on the project.
- Render enriched previews only when the URL is recognized.
- Keep the metadata portable across MySQL and PostgreSQL by storing it as `json`.
- Preserve the existing project submission and comment flows.

## Operational Note

- The form should not ask for a separate YouTube field anymore.
- Preview UI should fade/slide into view only after the URL is recognized.
- The legacy `youtube_url` path should be treated as a cleanup candidate, not part of the client-facing flow.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Add `raw_footage_metadata` to `projects` as portable `json`.
- [x] Derive provider metadata from `raw_footage_url` on the server.
- [x] Remove the separate `youtube_url` field from the client form.
- [x] Add live preview handling in the order form controller.
- [x] Render provider-aware previews on the client card and project detail pages.
- [x] Add focused unit and system coverage for the new flow.

- `spec/unit/models/project_spec.rb`
- `spec/system/project_show_comments_spec.rb`

## Checklist

- [x] The project stores raw footage metadata in a portable JSON column.
- [x] The client only sees `raw_footage_url`.
- [x] Recognized providers show a richer preview.
- [x] Unrecognized URLs fall back to the generic raw footage field.

## Validation

- [x] Unit specs cover metadata derivation.
- [x] System specs cover the updated project show/client card flow.

## Notes

- Leave the legacy `youtube_url` column for a later cleanup pass if needed.
