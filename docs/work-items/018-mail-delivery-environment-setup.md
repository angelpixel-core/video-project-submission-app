# Mail Delivery Environment Setup

## Goal

- [x] Configure mail delivery per environment so the PM notification mailer can be previewed locally and delivered in QA/production.

## Scope

- Use `letter_opener_web` for local mail previews in development.
- Keep test delivery isolated with the `:test` mailer adapter.
- Configure QA with SMTP settings provided through environment variables.
- Configure production with SMTP settings provided through environment variables.
- Keep provider secrets outside the repository and in the existing `ENV`/secret vars convention.

## Operational Note

- This item is infrastructure and environment wiring, not mail content.
- The PM notification mailer itself is already covered by the notification delivery work item.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] `Gemfile` - add `letter_opener_web` for development previews.
- [x] `config/environments/development.rb` - enable `letter_opener_web` for development.
- [x] `config/routes.rb` - mount the mail preview UI in development.
- [x] `config/environments/test.rb` - keep the `:test` delivery method intact.
- [x] `config/environments/qa.rb` - configure QA mail delivery from environment variables.
- [x] `config/environments/production.rb` - configure production mail delivery from environment variables.
- [x] `env/*/app/*.env` and/or deploy secrets - document the SMTP variables required per environment.

## Affected Docs

- `docs/work-items/013-notification-delivery-channels.md`
- `docs/work-items/014-in-app-pm-notifications.md`

## Affected Ops

- `config/environments/development.rb`
- `config/environments/test.rb`
- `config/environments/qa.rb`
- `config/environments/production.rb`
- `env/*/app/*.env` and deploy secret wiring
- `Gemfile`

## Checklist

- [x] Development can preview PM notification emails locally.
- [x] Test mail delivery remains isolated and non-networked.
- [x] QA can send or capture mail using SMTP settings from environment variables.
- [x] Production uses the intended transactional mail settings from environment variables.
- [x] The repo stays on the `ENV`/secret vars convention for mail secrets.

## Validation

- [x] A PM notification email can be previewed or inspected in development.
- [x] Test specs remain deterministic.
- [x] QA/production mail settings do not leak secrets into source control.

## Notes

- `letter_opener_web` is the chosen development preview tool.
- In development, open `http://localhost:4000/letter_opener` to browse generated emails, or use the configured `APP_PORT` if you override it.
- Keep this work item separate from the mailer content so provider setup stays isolated.
- QA/production should keep using the repo's existing environment-variable secret wiring; do not switch this work item to Rails credentials.
