# Render Infrastructure Requirements

## Goal

- [x] Define the Render-based infrastructure requirements for `qa` now.
  - [ ] Staging and prod remain future rollout surfaces.

## Scope

- Render service map for `qa`.
- Render account, workspace, and access bootstrap.
- PostgreSQL deployment strategy on Render.
- Custom domains, TLS, and DNS requirements.
- Environment variables, secrets, and resource sizing.
- Capacity and cost drivers for the deployment target.
- GitHub Actions handoff into Render.

- Current implementation target is QA only.

## Access Bootstrap

### Render Onboarding Choices

| Item | Selected Value | Manual Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace name | `video-project-submission-app` | I can identify the workspace by the repo name without ambiguity. |
| Workspace type | `Work` | I can confirm the workspace is for a real project, not a personal sandbox. |
| Team size | `Just me` | I can confirm the workspace is currently scoped to a solo maintainer. |
| What are you building? | `Website / landing page` | I can treat the app as a customer-facing web application in Render onboarding language. |
| Primary capability | `Developer velocity` | I can justify that fast deploy feedback matters more than advanced platform capabilities at this stage. |
| Secondary capability | `Security` | I can keep access control and credentials management explicit from the start. |

### Web Service Bootstrap Snapshot

| Field | Selected Value | Manual Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source code | `angelpixel-core / video-project-submission-app` | I can confirm the service is connected to the correct repository. |
| Service name | `video-project-submission-app` | I can see the current service name in Render. |
| Language | `Ruby` | I can confirm Render is treating the app as a Ruby runtime. |
| Branch | `development` | I can confirm the service deploys from the `development` branch. |
| Region | `Oregon (US West)` | I can confirm the Render region for this service. |
| Build command | `bundle install && npm ci && bundle exec vite build` | I can confirm the build step installs Ruby and Node dependencies and compiles assets. |
| Start command | `bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb` | I can confirm the service starts through Puma. |
| Env var | `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true` | I can confirm Rails logs are routed to stdout. |
| Env var | `RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<secret>` | I can confirm the Rails master key is configured as a secret. |
| Env var | `DATABASE_URL=<secret>` | I can confirm the service reads its DB connection from Render secrets. |

- If this service is the `qa` runtime, prefer renaming it to `video-project-submission-app-qa` before the first deploy so the service role is explicit.

### Render Workspace

| Item | Manual Verification |
| --- | --- |
| Render workspace URL | `https://dashboard.render.com/project/prj-d9a05upo3t8c7383lhag` | I can open the exact Render project page for this workspace. |
| Owner / team name | `video-project-submission-app` | I can identify the workspace team from the CLI workspace listing. |
| Create or confirm the Render account/workspace. | I can sign in to Render and see the workspace that will host the app. |
| Record the Render workspace URL and owner/team name. | I can point to the exact Render workspace URL and the responsible team/owner. |
| Create a Render API token for automation. | I can identify the token name and where it is stored without exposing the secret value. |
| Confirm the onboarding responses are recorded for the workspace. | I can point to the saved workspace name and selected onboarding options. |

### CLI Validation Snapshot

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `render --version` | `render v2.21.0` |
| `render workspaces -o text` | `video-project-submission-app / angel.szymczak@hotmail.com / tea-d99u3cnaqgkc738r033g` |
| `render services -o text` | `video-project-submission-app-qa` and `video-project-submission-app-qa-db` are visible in the active workspace. |

- The CLI installation is confirmed locally.
- The CLI can list the active workspace and services without exposing secrets.
- Use this snapshot as the terminal-side validation for the Render workspace bootstrap.

### Render CLI

Use the Render CLI to confirm the workspace, list services, and validate deployment access from the terminal.

#### Install

```shell
brew update
brew install render
```

Alternative macOS/Linux install:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/render-oss/cli/refs/heads/main/bin/install.sh | sh
```

#### Validate

```shell
render login
render workspaces -o text
render workspace set
render services -o text
```

- Use `render login` for an interactive local session.
- Use a Render API key with `RENDER_API_KEY` for automation and CI.
- Use the CLI to confirm the active workspace before relying on any workspace-scoped commands.

### URLs and External Access

| Item | Manual Verification |
| --- | --- |
| Define the public URL for `qa`. | I can name the hostname for the active public environment. |
| Define the DNS registrar/provider access path. | I can say who controls DNS and how records will be updated. |
| Define the GitHub Actions secret names needed for deployment. | I can list the secret names required for Render promotion and deploys. |

- DNS provider is not yet selected because the custom domain has not been purchased or wired up.
- QA currently uses the Render-managed `onrender.com` hostname, so no external DNS change is needed yet.
- Revisit this section once a custom domain is chosen.


### Public URLs

| Environment | Public URL | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `qa` | `https://video-project-submission-app-qa.onrender.com` | Confirmed from the Render CLI. |

- Use the Render-generated `onrender.com` URL for QA until the custom domain is ready.


### Custom Domains and TLS

| Environment | Public Hostname | TLS Termination | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `qa` | `qa.<placeholder-domain>` | Render-managed certificate | Used for automated deploy and QA validation. |

- Render should terminate TLS for each public hostname.
- Keep the hostname values as placeholders until the real DNS zone is finalized.
- DNS records should point the public hostname to the matching Render service target when QA leaves placeholder mode.


### Keys and Tokens

| Item | Manual Verification |
| --- | --- |
| Create a Render API token for automation. | I can confirm the API key exists and is stored as the `RENDER_API_KEY` GitHub Actions secret. |
| Keep Render access credentials out of git. | I know where the token lives and can rotate it without a repo change. |
| Keep DNS provider credentials out of git. | I know which secret store or account holds DNS access. |
| Keep deployment tokens separate from human login credentials. | I can distinguish the automation token from personal account access. |

### Credential Policies

#### Render Access Credentials

| Credential | Stored In | Never Commit | Rotation | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Render API key | GitHub Actions secret `RENDER_API_KEY` | Raw key material, CLI token dumps, or Render dashboard exports | Recreate in Render, then update the GitHub secret | `gh secret list --repo angelpixel-core/video-project-submission-app --app actions` |
| Render CLI token | Local Render CLI config (`~/.render/cli.yaml`) | Local config files, dotfiles, or repo env files | Re-run `render login` | `render workspaces -o text` |
| Render service ID for QA | GitHub Actions secret `RENDER_QA_SERVICE_ID` | Service ID values in tracked env files | Recopy from Render after service changes | `gh secret list --repo angelpixel-core/video-project-submission-app --app actions` |



#### DNS Provider Credentials

| Credential | Stored In | Never Commit | Rotation | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DNS API key / token | DNS provider account or secret store | `env/`, docs, or repo secrets unless the provider is the system of record | Reissue in the DNS provider and update the secret store | Provider dashboard and secret inventory |
| DNS zone ownership | Registrar / DNS provider account | Repo files or Render settings | Update registrar access when ownership changes | Domain registrar / DNS console |

- DNS provider access remains undecided until a custom domain exists.
- When the provider is chosen, store its credentials in the provider or a secret store, not in git.

#### Deployment Tokens

| Token Type | Stored In | Never Commit | Rotation | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions runtime token | GitHub-managed `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Hardcoded token values | Automatic per workflow run | Presence in workflow context |
| Render deploy automation secret | GitHub Actions secret `RENDER_API_KEY` | Repo files or plaintext envs | Recreate in Render, then update the secret | Smoke workflow or `gh secret list` |
| Human login credentials | Human password / SSO / browser session | Any repo file or automation secret | Account settings / identity provider | Login in browser or SSO flow |

- Keep human login credentials and automation tokens in separate systems.
- Use `gh secret set` for repository or environment secrets.
- Use `gh secret list` for metadata-only verification.
- Use a workflow smoke test to confirm the token works at runtime.

### GitHub Actions Secrets and Vars

| Kind | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secret | `RENDER_API_KEY` | Authenticates the Render CLI in GitHub Actions. |
| Secret | `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` | Shared Rails master key for QA, staging, and prod. |
| Secret | `RENDER_QA_SERVICE_ID` | Targets the QA Render web service. |
| Secret | `RENDER_STAGING_SERVICE_ID` | Targets the staging Render web service. |
| Secret | `RENDER_PROD_SERVICE_ID` | Targets the production Render web service. |
| Variable | `RENDER_QA_ENVIRONMENT_ID` | Supplies the QA Render environment ID to Terraform. |
| Variable | `RENDER_STAGING_ENVIRONMENT_ID` | Supplies the staging Render environment ID to Terraform. |
| Variable | `RENDER_PROD_ENVIRONMENT_ID` | Supplies the production Render environment ID to Terraform. |

- Use one Rails master key secret unless the app later proves it needs per-environment keys.
- Use one service ID secret per environment so deploys stay explicit.
- Use one environment ID variable per environment so Terraform stays readable.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided by GitHub Actions automatically and does not need a manual secret entry.
- The GitHub CLI can set these secrets with `gh secret set` and repository variables with `gh variable set`.

### Secret Operations

| Operation | Tool / Protocol | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate | Render dashboard / provider UI | Create the secret at the source system first. |
| Set | `gh secret set` | Store repository or environment secrets in GitHub Actions. |
| Bulk set | `gh secret set -f <dotenv-file>` | Load multiple secret names from a dotenv-formatted file. |
| List / verify presence | `gh secret list` | Confirms the secret name exists and shows metadata only. |
| Validate runtime use | GitHub Actions smoke job | Confirms the workflow can read the secret without exposing the value. |

- Do not expect a true `get` for secret values from GitHub; GitHub only exposes metadata for security.
- For Render API keys, generate in Render first, then store the resulting value in `RENDER_API_KEY`.
- For deployment service IDs, copy the IDs from Render CLI or dashboard and store them in GitHub Actions secrets.
- For versioned placeholder files, keep `env/*/secrets.local.env` checked in with `__SET_MANUALLY__` placeholders.
- If the workflow needs repeated secret setup, add a small helper script later instead of copying ad hoc commands.

### Secret Automation Interface

Use `make` as the user-facing entry point and `ops/scripts/secrets.sh` as the implementation layer.

| Command | Purpose | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `make secrets/init ENV=qa` | Ensure placeholder secret files exist for the selected environment. | local filesystem |
| `make secrets/set ENV=qa TARGET=github` | Push exported `RENDER_*` values or one-off `SECRET_NAME/SECRET_VALUE` pairs into GitHub Actions secrets. | GitHub |
| `make secrets/set ENV=qa TARGET=render` | Prepare or validate Render-side deployment secrets. | Render |
| `make secrets/set ENV=qa TARGET=local` | Materialize local Docker/runtime secret values from the selected environment. | local Docker |
| `make secrets/list ENV=qa TARGET=github` | List secret metadata for the selected environment. | GitHub |
| `make secrets/validate ENV=qa TARGET=github` | Smoke-test that GitHub Actions can read the configured secrets at runtime. | GitHub Actions |

- `Makefile` should remain a thin wrapper around `ops/scripts/secrets.sh`.
- `ops/scripts/secrets.sh` should read versioned placeholders from `env/${ENV}/app/secrets.local.env`, `env/${ENV}/db/secrets.local.env`, and `env/${ENV}/stack/secrets.local.env`, then write runtime values to `env/.local/${ENV}.env`.
- GitHub secret sync should use exported `RENDER_*` environment variables or `SECRET_NAME`/`SECRET_VALUE` for one-off updates.
- Keep `TARGET` explicit so the same command shape works for GitHub, Render, and local Docker.
- A future `rotate` command can reuse the same script once the first pass is stable.
- Local `TARGET=local` writes runtime values to `env/.local/${ENV}.env` so Compose can read them without dirtying git.
- `SECRET_NAME` and `SECRET_VALUE` can be used for one-off secret operations when a single value needs to be generated, set, or read.
- `TARGET=local` writes to the ignored `env/.local/${ENV}.env` overlay, and the stack wrapper ensures that file exists for Compose.
- `RENDER_API_BASE_URL` can be overridden in tests or mocks; production defaults to the Render API.

### PostgreSQL Bootstrap Snapshot

| Item | Selected Value | Manual Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database name | `video_project_submission_app_qa_db` | I can identify the QA database by a stable environment-specific name. |
| Database user | `video_project_submission_app_qa` | I can identify the dedicated DB user for the QA environment. |
| Region | `Oregon (US West)` | I can confirm the database lives in the same region as the app service. |
| PostgreSQL version | `18` | I can confirm the version selected in Render. |
| Plan | `Free` | I can confirm the initial plan choice for the bootstrap phase. |
| Storage | `1 GB` | I can confirm the initial storage allocation. |
| Storage autoscaling | `Disabled` | I can confirm autoscaling is off for the bootstrap database. |
| High availability | `Disabled` | I can confirm HA is off for the bootstrap database. |
| Inbound IP policy | `0.0.0.0/0` visible in the UI | I can confirm the current network exposure setting that Render shows for this database. |

### DATABASE_URL Source

- Use the Render **Internal Database URL** for the web service `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
- Do not use the external URL for the app runtime unless you have a specific off-platform client that needs it.
- Treat the password and full connection string as secrets and keep them out of git.

## Render Service Map

### Render Runtime Environments

| Environment | Web Service | Database | Domain | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `qa` | `video-project-submission-app-qa` | Managed PostgreSQL | `qa.<placeholder-domain>` | Used for automated deploy + QA validation. |

- QA is the only active deployment target right now.

### Local Development Context

| Environment | Web Service | Database | Domain | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dev` | Local Rails web service | Local MySQL | `dev.lvh.me` | Developer loop only; not a Render environment. |
| `test` | Local Rails web service | Local MySQL | `test.lvh.me` | Automated test context; not a Render environment. |

### Render vs Local Boundary

- The runtime environments documented in this work item currently cover `qa`.
- Local `dev` and `test` are separate contexts for developer flow and automated checks.
- Local `dev/test` keep MySQL because that is the current baseline for development and CI.
- `dev.lvh.me` and `test.lvh.me` are local-only domains and do not imply a Render deployment target.

### Naming Convention

- Use long, explicit service names for Render to keep the environment role obvious in multi-environment operations.
- Keep local `dev` and `test` as separate context rows so the full runtime picture stays readable without implying they are Render targets.
- Use `lvh.me` for local subdomains because it resolves to `127.0.0.1` and supports host-based local routing without extra host file entries.

### PostgreSQL Deployment Mode

Use one Render-managed PostgreSQL database per runtime environment.

| Environment | Database Mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `qa` | Managed PostgreSQL service | Dedicated database for QA validation. |

### Rationale

- Keep database boundaries aligned with environment boundaries.
- Avoid sharing state between runtime targets.
- Use the native managed PostgreSQL product offered by Render.
- Keep local `dev/test` on MySQL, since those contexts are already defined outside Render.


### Web Service by Environment

| Environment | Web Service | Purpose | Deployment Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `qa` | `video-project-submission-app-qa` | Automated deploy + QA validation | GitHub Actions promotion from `work-items/*` -> `development` | Public Render environment. |



### Manual Verification

- I can explain what runs in the `qa` web service.
- I can point to the branch or promotion path that feeds QA.
- I can distinguish Render runtime environments from local `dev/test` contexts.

## Notes

- Prefer separate services for the web runtime and the database.
- Use PostgreSQL on Render for `qa` to match the deployment target.
- Future rollout note: `staging` and `prod` are intentionally out of scope for this work item.
- Keep the document focused on infrastructure requirements, not implementation details.
- Treat Redis as optional until the application actually needs it.
- Use placeholders for domains and secret names when the real values are not yet finalized.
- This work item should stay limited to requirements that unblock the remaining deployment-promotion steps in `docs/work-items/003-ci-cd-and-environments.md`.
- The secret-management interface is intentionally thin: `make` delegates to `ops/scripts/secrets.sh`.
