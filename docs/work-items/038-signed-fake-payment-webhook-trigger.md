# Signed Fake Payment Webhook Trigger

## Goal

- [x] Provide a local rake/make trigger for sending a signed fake `payment.succeeded` webhook.

## Scope

- Keep the existing generic webhook simulator task.
- Add a convenience task that defaults to a successful payment webhook.
- Add a `make` wrapper so the trigger can run from the repo root.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Add a rake task that sends a signed fake webhook with `payment.succeeded` as the default type.
- [x] Add a `make` wrapper for the new rake task.
- [x] Keep env-var overrides for local demos and testing.
- [x] Add specs for the new task.

## Affected Docs

- `docs/work-items/033-payment-webhook-ingestion.md`
- `docs/work-items/034-payment-event-handler-pipeline.md`

## Affected Ops

- `lib/tasks/payments.rake`
- `Makefile`
- `spec/unit/tasks/`

## Checklist

- [x] The repo can trigger a signed fake successful payment webhook from `rake`.
- [x] The repo can trigger the same flow from `make`.

## Validation

- [x] Task specs pass.

## Notes

- This is a convenience wrapper over the existing webhook simulator.
